Background / Scenario
In this research-oriented lab, you will research information about cloud computing security and prepare for a recommendation for an organization that is deploying their eCommerce option to the cloud.

A startup company is considering a cloud solution for their eCommerce business. The company designs and sells customized clothing and home decoration items to customers around the world. The company hopes the cloud solution can provide key functions including:

Product search and display with multiple presentations (searching, zooming, and viewing from different angles, etc.)
Product ordering (order confirmation, delivery tracking and notification, order history, etc.)
Customer service
Advertising and promotion
Sales tracking and reporting
As an IT security specialist, you are asked to research and prepare a report evaluating potential cloud solutions and their security implications.

## Instructions

# Part 1: Research and Recommend a Cloud Model and a Cloud Service Model
Cloud models include public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and community cloud. Cloud service models include Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Which cloud service model would you recommend to meet the feature requirements of the company? Explain.

Answer : 
For startups that design and sell customized apparel and home decor items, it is more advisable to use the 'Hybrid Cloud' model along with the 'Software as a Service (SaaS)' cloud service model.

#### Explanation: 1. **Hybrid Cloud Model**: 
- **Flexibility**: Hybrid cloud allows businesses to leverage both public and private cloud resources. This is beneficial for balancing sensitive customer data and business-critical applications (which can be placed in the private cloud) with scalable, cost-saving public cloud resources for other functions.
- **Scalability**: As the business grows, businesses can easily scale their resources in the public cloud without the need for significant hardware investments.
- **Data Security**: Sensitive information such as customer data can be stored in a more secure private cloud environment, while less sensitive operations, such as product display and advertising, can leverage the public cloud.

2. **SaaS Model**: 
- **Ease of Use**: SaaS solutions offer ready-to-use applications that require minimal setup, making them ideal for startups that may not have extensive IT resources.
- **Core Functionality**: With SaaS, companies can implement essential eCommerce functions, such as product search and display, order management (confirmation, tracking, and history), and customer service applications, without having to develop these capabilities from scratch.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: SaaS typically operates on a subscription basis, reducing upfront costs and providing predictable monthly costs, which is critical for startups.

# Part 2: Identify Shared Responsibility for Cloud Services and Cloud Security
Think about shared responsibility for security between the company and a cloud provider for the cloud service model recommended. Use the table below and mark each box with Client, Shared, or Cloud Provider.

Record your chosen cloud service model:
Answer : 

- Data Security: Responsibility is shared between the client and the cloud provider, where the client must ensure that the data they input is secure, while the cloud provider is responsible for protecting the data stored.
- Application Security: A shared responsibility, where the SaaS provider is responsible for keeping their applications secure, while the client is responsible for configuring and using the applications in a secure manner.
- Access Management: The sole responsibility lies with the client to manage who has access to their applications and data.
- Legal Compliance: Responsibility is shared between the client and the provider, where both must ensure that all policies and regulations are followed.
- Physical Security: This responsibility lies entirely with the cloud provider, who must ensure that their data center is secure.

## Enter the security responsibilities for your chosen cloud service model:

Data = Client

Endpoints = Shared

Identity Management = Shared

Application = Cloud Provider

Network Control = Cloud Provider

Operating System = Cloud Provider

Physical Infrastructure = Cloud Provider

### Part 3: Identify Five Security Threats Related to Cloud Computing 1. **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized individuals accessing sensitive customer and transactional information.
2. **Insider Threats**: Disgruntled employees or third-party vendors engaging in harmful actions that jeopardize cloud security.
3. **Account Compromise**: Cybercriminals take over user accounts, resulting in potential data exposure or alterations.
4. **Vulnerable APIs**: APIs that lack proper security measures, making them susceptible to exploitation by attackers.
5. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**: Flooding cloud resources with excessive traffic, hindering access for legitimate users.

### Part 4: Identify Five Security Measures for Deploying eCommerce Cloud Solution 1. **Data Encryption**: Implement encryption for all customer information, both during transmission and while stored, to safeguard against unauthorized access.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Use MFA to enhance account security, ensuring that only verified users can access sensitive data and services.
3. **Routine Security Assessments and Penetration Testing**: Regularly conduct security checks and tests to find and fix vulnerabilities in the eCommerce platform.
4. **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**: Deploy WAFs to defend against typical web threats, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
5. **Data Backup and Recovery Planning**: Establish a consistent backup schedule and a solid recovery plan to address potential data loss or system failures.

### Reflection Questions 
1. **What are some benefits of deploying online services in the cloud?** 
- **Scalability**: Cloud solutions can dynamically adjust resources based on demand, which is particularly useful during high-traffic periods like sales events.
 - **Cost Efficiency**: Utilizing the cloud reduces the need for significant upfront investments in hardware, allowing businesses to pay only for the services they consume.
 - **Global Accessibility**: Cloud-based platforms can be accessed from anywhere, facilitating interactions for both customers and staff across the globe.
 - **Automatic Maintenance**: Cloud providers handle system updates and maintenance, ensuring the infrastructure remains up-to-date without requiring manual effort.

2. **Can the company rely on the cloud solution provider for everything, including services and security? Explain.** 
- No, the company cannot depend entirely on the cloud provider for all aspects of service and security. While cloud providers manage the underlying infrastructure (such as hardware and network security), the company must take responsibility for securing its applications, safeguarding customer data, and managing user access. This represents a shared responsibility model, where both the provider and the company must work together to ensure robust security.
