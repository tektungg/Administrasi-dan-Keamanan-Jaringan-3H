### Background / Scenario

In this research-oriented lab, you will research information about cloud computing security and prepare for a recommendation for an organization that is deploying their eCommerce option to the cloud.

A startup company is considering a cloud solution for their eCommerce business. The company designs and sells customized clothing and home decoration items to customers around the world. The company hopes the cloud solution can provide key functions including:

- Product search and display with multiple presentations (searching, zooming, and viewing from different angles, etc.)
- Product ordering (order confirmation, delivery tracking and notification, order history, etc.)
- Customer service
- Advertising and promotion
- Sales tracking and reporting

As an IT security specialist, you are asked to research and prepare a report evaluating potential cloud solutions and their security implications.

### Required Resources

- A computer with internet access

## Instructions

### Part 1: Research and Recommend a Cloud Model and a Cloud Service Model

Cloud models include public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and community cloud. Cloud service models include Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Which cloud service model would you recommend to meet the feature requirements of the company? Explain.

- I recommend Software as a Service (SaaS) for the companyâ€™s eCommerce solution. SaaS provides a complete software solution, where the cloud provider hosts and maintains the application, allowing the company to focus solely on business operations without worrying about application development or infrastructure management.

### Part 2: Identify Shared Responsibility for Cloud Services and Cloud Security

Think about shared responsibility for security between the company and a cloud provider for the cloud service model recommended. Use the table below and mark each box with Client, Shared, or Cloud Provider.

Record your chosen cloud service model:

- Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Data -> Client
- Endpoints -> Shared
- Identity Management -> Shared
- Application -> Cloud Provider
- Network Control -> Cloud Provider
- Operating System -> Cloud Provider
- Physical Infrastructure -> Cloud Provider

### Part 3: Identify Five Security Threats Related to Cloud Computing

List at least 5 security threats related to cloud computing.

- Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive customer and transaction data.
- Insider Threats: Malicious actions by employees or third-party service providers that compromise the cloud environment.
- Account Hijacking: Attackers gaining control of user accounts, leading to data leaks or manipulation.
- Insecure APIs: Poorly implemented APIs that are vulnerable to attacks, leading to system exploitation.
- Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Overwhelming cloud services with traffic, preventing legitimate users from accessing the eCommerce site.

### Part 4: Identify Five Security Measures for Deploying eCommerce Cloud Solution

Perform an internet search to find out security measures required to secure an eCommerce cloud solution.

- Data Encryption: Ensure that all customer data (both in transit and at rest) is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA to secure user accounts and ensure only authorized individuals can access sensitive resources.
- Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct frequent audits and tests to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen the security of the eCommerce platform.
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Use a WAF to protect against common web-based attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Data Backup and Disaster Recovery: Ensure regular backups and a disaster recovery plan are in place to mitigate the impact of data loss or system outages.

### Reflection Questions

#### 1. What are some benefits of deploying online services in cloud?

- Scalability: Cloud platforms can automatically scale resources to meet demand, especially during peak shopping seasons.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Cloud solutions eliminate the need for upfront hardware investments, and businesses only pay for what they use.
- Accessibility: Cloud-based services can be accessed from anywhere in the world, allowing customers and employees to interact with the system globally.
- Automatic Updates: Cloud providers manage system updates, ensuring that the infrastructure stays current without manual intervention.

#### 2. Can the company rely on the cloud solution provider for everything including services and security? Explain.

- No, the company cannot rely solely on the cloud provider for everything. Cloud providers are responsible for managing the infrastructure (e.g., hardware, network, physical security), but the company is responsible for securing their applications, customer data, and user access. This is a shared responsibility model where both parties need to collaborate to ensure comprehensive security.
