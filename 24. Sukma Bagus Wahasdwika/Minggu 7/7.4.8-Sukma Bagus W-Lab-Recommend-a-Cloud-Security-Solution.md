# 7.4.8 Lab - Recommend a Cloud Security Solution

## Objectives

Part 1: Research and Recommend a Cloud Model and a Cloud Service Model

Part 2: Identify Shared Responsibility for Cloud Services and Cloud Security

Part 3: Identify Five Security Threats Related to Cloud Computing

Part 4: Identify Five Security Measures for Deploying eCommerce in Cloud

## Background / Scenario
In this research-oriented lab, you will research information about cloud computing security and prepare for a recommendation for an organization that is deploying their eCommerce option to the cloud.

A startup company is considering a cloud solution for their eCommerce business. The company designs and sells customized clothing and home decoration items to customers around the world. The company hopes the cloud solution can provide key functions including:

- Product search and display with multiple presentations (searching, zooming, and viewing from different angles, etc.)
- Product ordering (order confirmation, delivery tracking and notification, order history, etc.)
- Customer service
- Advertising and promotion
- Sales tracking and reporting

As an IT security specialist, you are asked to research and prepare a report evaluating potential cloud solutions and their security implications.

## Required Resources
- A computer with internet access

## Instructions

### Part 1: Research and Recommend a Cloud Model and a Cloud Service Model
Cloud models include public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and community cloud. Cloud service models include Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Which cloud service model would you recommend to meet the feature requirements of the company? Explain.

> Cloud publik, karena skalabilitas global dan efektivitas biayanya yang sesuai dengan basis pelanggan perusahaan di seluruh dunia. Untuk model layanan cloud, SaaS sangat ideal karena menawarkan solusi eCommerce siap pakai, mengurangi kebutuhan perusahaan untuk mengelola infrastruktur dan memungkinkan mereka untuk fokus pada bisnis mereka.

### Part 2: Identify Shared Responsibility for Cloud Services and Cloud Security
Think about shared responsibility for security between the company and a cloud provider for the cloud service model recommended. Use the table below and mark each box with Client, Shared, or Cloud Provider.
> Model layanan cloud, SaaS, tanggung jawab atas layanan dan keamanan cloud dibagi antara penyedia cloud dan klien. Penyedia cloud mengelola infrastruktur, aplikasi, dan keamanan platform yang mendasarinya, sementara klien bertanggung jawab untuk mengelola data pengguna, manajemen akun, dan memastikan kontrol akses yang tepat.

Record your chosen cloud service model:
> - Data = Client
> - Endpoints = Shared
> - Identity Management = Shared
> - Application = Cloud Provider
> - Network Control = Cloud Provider
> - Operating System = Cloud Provider
> - Physical Infrastucture = Cloud Provider

### Part 3: Identify Five Security Threats Related to Cloud Computing
List at least 5 security threats related to cloud computing
> - Threat 1: Data breaches
> - Threat 2: Insufficient Identity and Access Management (IAM)
> - Threat 3: Account hijacking
> - Threat 4: Insecure APIs
> - Threat 5: Improper data governance

### Part 4: Identify Five Security Measures for Deploying eCommerce Cloud Solution
Perform an internet search to find out security measures required to secure an eCommerce cloud solution.
> - Strong company security policies
> - Proper IAM configuration
> - Encryption and SSL/TLS for secure data transmission
> - Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
> - Secure web interface with HTTPS

### Reflection Questions
1. What are some benefits of deploying online services in cloud?
> - Cost efficiency
> - Enhanced security
> - Scalability and flexibility
> - Access from anywhere (mobility)
> - Improved collaboration
> - Reliable disaster recovery
> - Automatic updates and maintenance

2. Can the company rely on the cloud solution provider for everything including services and security? Explain.
> No, the company cannot depend entirely on the cloud provider for all services and security. Cloud computing operates under a shared responsibility model. While the provider handles the infrastructure and platform security, the company is still responsible for securing its data, managing user access, and implementing its own security policies.
